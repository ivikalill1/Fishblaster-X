Fishblaster X was based off of Space Invaders, but instead of taking place in space, the game is themed around the ocean.
The game features two types of enemies- the purple fish whom you have to kill to get points and the pufferfish who's the guardian of the ocean floor and also immortal. Touching the pufferfish will result in the player's death.
